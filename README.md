# Gravity and Drop
### A simple drag, plot and observe simulation based on the planetary grvitational forces observed in our universe
I have tried to create a simulation which will help people understand different parameters of orbital velocities, gravitational attractions and other hi fi stuff. (This is WIP and will be updated regularly)

### Instructions
Drag and drop the planets near the sun.
the length of the drawn vector will represent the force by which the planet will be launched.
Watch it's trajectory and influence due to gravitational potential of the sun.
also see the beahvioural changes in the graph.
